Runic-Dust-Mod-v2
=================

Hello, and welcome to the official repo of the Runic Dust Mod continuation project.  This repo is/will be designed to 
allow for collaboration on what is one of the larger continuation projects out there.

If you want to submit a code change, make a pull request and I will see if it should be merged into the branch; they usually 
will unless it is something stupid (such as throwing a ton of spam into the minecraft log for no real reason).

Localizations
=============

If you want to help translate the mod into a certain language, just look into the en_US.lang file (which is found in the
assets/runicdust/lang directory) for the item, block, and tile namings.  Then, just make a pull request and I will add it 
to the repo ASAP.


I have also made it so you can translate the entries that are found in the runic tome.  The loading of it needs some work, but for the most part it is ready for action.  The translating work can begin now-

1. First, look in the assets/dustdefault/runedata/en_US/ for the entries to translate.
2. Make a seperate folder that matches the Minecraft name for the lang file of the language you are translating.
3. Put all entries (make sure they share the names of the originals) inside of the folder you created.

The game should read them without any problem if you follow this correctly.


Guidelines For Submitting an Issue
==================================

1. Be sure the issue has not already been reported and/or closed already.
2. Always include the mod version, crash report when availible(pastebin please!) and other proof of the issue.
3. Be clear with what the reported error is; if I don't understand the problem, I cannot fix it.
